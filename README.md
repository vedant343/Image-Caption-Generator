# Image-Caption-Generator
Whenever an image appears in front of us, our brain can annotate or label it. But what about computers? How can a machine process and label an image with a highly relevant and accurate caption? It seemed quite impossible a few years back. Still, with the enhancement of Computer Vision and Deep learning algorithms, the availability of relevant datasets, and AI models, it becomes easier to build a relevant caption generator for an image. Even Caption generation is growing worldwide, and many data annotation firms are earning billions. In this guide, we will build one such annotation tool capable of generating relevant captions for the image with the help of datasets. Basic knowledge of two Deep learning techniques, including LSTM and CNN, is required.
